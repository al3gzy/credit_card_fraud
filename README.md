# Credit Card Fraud Detection  

A machine learning project for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using multiple classification models.  

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This project analyzes transaction data from `creditcard.csv` to classify transactions as **fraudulent (1)** or **legitimate (0)**.  
It addresses **class imbalance** and evaluates different machine learning models for fraud detection.  

## Features  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values and balancing the dataset.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Understanding fraud vs. non-fraud transactions.  
- **Model Training**: Applying **Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Naive Bayes Classifier and Gradient Boosted Tree.**  
- **Evaluation**: Comparing model performance and accuracy.
